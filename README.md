# advanced-speech-to-text-app

A research based project to implement vosk model into an android app developed using Jetpack Compose. 
Vosk model helps to implement offline speech-to-text functionalities. This model is available for different platforms like android, python, javascript, C# and iOS.
In  this project I will be exploring how to integrate vosk into into a speech-to-text app build using android Jetpack Compose. Further more, the app listens for a wakeup call,
which in this case is "Apple pie banana" and when these words are recognised, the app starts recording your voice and converts to text. 3 seconds of non-activity(not speaking) turns off the transcption.
